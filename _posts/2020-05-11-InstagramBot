## Instagram Bot 

The bot is coded in python and uses selenium (plus its drivers) . I used the firefox as a host for the bot.

**Bot Functionality**

*Opens FireFox browser
*Opens [Instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/)
*Logs in (provided you've given the username and password)
*Searches for an account (provided you've given the account name)
*Automated Following/Liking/Posting
*Closing the browser

**Requirments :**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Python Extension - Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
* [FireFox geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* An instagram account (So the bot can use the account)
* [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Code explanation to be added soon ...

** Warnings ** If you get the error element not found in xpath (...) , It is because in the future they may update website changing the xpath or its id . A simple fix is to right click on the element in the page and click on inspect . Then right click on the highlighted part -> copy -> xpath , replace the new xpath by overwritting the old one .
