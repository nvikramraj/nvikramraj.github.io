## Installation of Pytorch using Anaconda

To start with Neural Netoworks , we need some packages to make calculations easier.

The Packages I used :

* Pytorch
* Open cv
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Tqdm
* NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
* NVIDIA cuDNN

I created an environment to hold the above packages in anaconda.
Which you can get from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) 

**Recommended to not add it in path , use the anaconda cmd instead**

## Commands to run in anaconda cmd to install packages :

1. Create environment

	conda create -n env_name (no quotes "")

2. Activate environment 

	conda activate env_name

3. Install Python (I installed 3.7 vr)

	conda install python=3.7

4. Install Pytorch

	There are many ways to install Pytorch . The one I downloaded is shown below.
	You get Pip , NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and numpy with Pytorch

	conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

	Create your own pytorch installation command [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

5. Install NVIDIA cuDNN

	conda install -c anaconda cudnn

6. Install Open CV

	pip install open-cv

7. Install matplotlib

	pip install matplotlib

8. Install tqdm

	pip install tqdm

Once you've installed all the packages . It should look something like this when you run
the command "conda list"

You can crosscheck your versions if you want.

9. To deactivate environment

	conda deactivate

It is also find if you don't want to use anaconda . But it is recommended to use because if everthing is global, it will crash sometimes . And it is easy to manage updates in anaconda.
